Erasmus Student Network

ESN is the biggest international student organisation with 538 sections across the world. We strive to help all international students feel welcome in Ghent during their exchange.
We organise 2 to 3 events per week for all international students. These events can be cultural, social, sports, trips, parties, etc.  This way everyone can find something they like. We also help international students with questions they might have about finding their way at university/college, in the city,... through our buddy system.
