Chinese Students and scholars Association

CHISAG is an organisation of Chinese students and scholars in Ghent which helps their integration and support their work, study and spare time entertainment.
Every year we welcome new-coming Chinese students and scholars, organise galas during Chinese festivals, and cooperate with other associations for cross-cultural activities.
