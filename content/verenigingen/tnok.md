Tomo no Kai is a student association of Japanologists, aiming for a cultural exchange between Japanese and Belgian students.
On one hand, we strongly aim to promote the Japanese culture to our members through a diverse amount of events. On the other hand, we help to accommodate Japanese exchange students as well as promoting the Belgian culture to visiting students.
